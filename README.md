# Python Small Projects ðŸš€
A collection of mini Python programs that I built while learning.  
These projects cover different topics and are useful for beginners and practice.

## Projects

1. [Number Guessing Game](./Number-Guessing-Game.py)  
"Test your luck and wits! Can you guess the secret number within 5 tries?  
Get hints, track attempts, and see if you can beat the challenge!"

2. [Koun Banega Crorepati](./KBC.py)  
"Step into the hot seat and play your own KBC!  
Answer exciting questions, earn rewards, and see if you can become a champion!"
